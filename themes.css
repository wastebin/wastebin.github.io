/*
  color system ideas:
  * fill-a, fill-b, accent-a, accent-b
  * dualistic (scale between two contrasting colors, possibly a, b, c, d, e?)
    an advantage of this is that themes that are light-dark can simply be inverted for light/dark modes
  * materialistic (primary/secondary + variant, bg, surface, error, primary text, secondary text, bg text, surface text, error text; named after googleâ€™s material design)
